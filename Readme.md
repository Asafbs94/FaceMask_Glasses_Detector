# FaceMask & Glasses Dectector ✨

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Overview 📌
The project aims to detect people wearing masks/glasses in live video streams using deep learning techniques. It utilizes the YOLOv5 object detection framework combined with Cython for improved performance. The system can identify individuals wearing masks or glasses in real-time and can be used for various applications such as surveillance, safety monitoring, or public health management.

## Installation ⚙️

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Create a Python 3.7 environment using your preferred method (e.g., virtualenv, conda).
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repository`
4. Install the required packages by running the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage 🚀

🔧 Describe how to use your project and provide examples or code snippets if applicable. For example:

1. Run the `Detection_on_Video.py` script to start the detection on a live video stream.
2. Adjust the settings or parameters in the script as needed.
3. The output will be displayed on the screen, showing detections of people wearing masks or glasses.

```python
python Detection_on_Video.py
```
